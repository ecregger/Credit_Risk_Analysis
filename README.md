# Credit_Risk_Analysis
The basis of this analysis is to create several different machine-learning models in order to determine whether they will be useful to predict someone's loan risk upon application. 

## Resampling Models
- <h2>Naive Random Oversampling: </h2> This method is not ideal due to the nearly non-existent precision score in predicting high risk alongside the flow f1 scores. </p> <b>Acc:</b> .64, <b>low / high risk precision:</b> 0.01
